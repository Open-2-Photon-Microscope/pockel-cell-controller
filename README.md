# Pockel_cell_driver
An open source circuit to synchronise laser intensity with the recording system of a 2-Photon microscope, by controlling the signal that reaches the laser's Pockel Cell. 


The main purpose of this circuit is to condition an analog signal using an fast switch IC that opens and closes the analog line using a digital 0-5V square signal (0V circuit open, 5V circuit closed). The original switching signal is 1.6ms at 5V and 0.4ms at 0V (composing a 500Hz signal), but other signals can be used.

This board can take an internal analog signal, where the signal amplitude (and therefore the laser intensity) is set by a potentiometer, or an external signal connected via a BNC cable.
