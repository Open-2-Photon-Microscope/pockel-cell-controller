# Pockel_cell_driver
An open source electronic circuit to drive Pockel cells.

## Credit:
- The Pockels' cell driver was inspired by earlier devices designed and built by R. Berndt ([HIH TÃ¼bingen](<https://www.hih-tuebingen.de/en/>)), part of a project of [T. Euler's lab](<http://www.eye-tuebingen.de/eulerlab/>). See image below for original schematic
